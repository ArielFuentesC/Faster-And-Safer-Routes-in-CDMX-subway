# Faster-And-Safer-routes-in-CDMX-subway

## Motivation. 

After almost three years since COVID-19 epidemic, the number of infections is still an alarm. Notwithstanding, Mexico is trying to come back to the so called "old normality".
Mexico city, CDMX, is one of the largest cities around the world, therefore, it is usual to find lots of people on public transport, particularly in the subway. Then, it is necessary to deal with a few problems; the need to return to our old life, the number of infections, and really busy subway stations. 
This is a project that porpouse citizens alternative subway routes to travel through the city faster and safer. This, helped by a rebuilt database of affluence per station of subway and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## About repository.

Here, you will find those databases used in the project. "AfluenciaMetro" is a rebuilt database version of the database provided by CDMX goverment; https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/afluencia-diaria-del-metro-cdmx in the other hand, "Coodernadas" contains the exact coordinates of each subway station. Finally, "metro" is a brief csv used to described nodes and edges in our graph. 
Moreover, you will find some reports, deeply describing each step, making asymptotic time and space analysis, and proposing future works.
